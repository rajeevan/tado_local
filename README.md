# What works
- I'm able to integrate with **[AmpScm/TadoLocal](https://github.com/AmpScm/TadoLocal)** service. 
- All my zones are showing
- Adjusting temperature working on correct zones

# Not working / Wrong
- HVAC mode toggleing to off does turn off the zone, but status in HA shows as Heat and can't change back to Heat!

# Tado Local for Home Assistant (HACS)

This integration provides a Home Assistant interface for the **[AmpScm/TadoLocal](https://github.com/AmpScm/TadoLocal)** service. 

While the official Tado integration relies on the Tado Cloud API (which is subject to rate limits and internet dependency), this integration communicates directly with the **TadoLocal bridge** running on your network. This allows for faster local control and ensures your heating stays manageable even if the internet goes down.

## What is this for?
This HACS integration is the "client" part of a local-control setup. It connects to the API endpoints provided by the [AmpScm/TadoLocal](https://github.com/AmpScm/TadoLocal) project. 

**Key Benefits:**
- **Local-Only**: No traffic sent to Tado's cloud servers for heating commands.
- **Bypass Rate Limits**: Avoid the daily request quotas recently introduced for Tado Cloud users.
- **Improved Latency**: Commands are sent directly over your LAN.

## Prerequisites
Before installing this integration, you must have the **TadoLocal API service** up and running. 
- **API Repository**: [AmpScm/TadoLocal](https://github.com/AmpScm/TadoLocal)
- You will need the **IP address**, **Port** (default 8000), and the **Bearer Token** generated by that service.

## Features
- **Automatic Discovery**: Automatically adds Climate entities for every Tado Zone found on the bridge.
- **Real-time Status**: Fetches current temperature, humidity, and target setpoints.
- **Full Control**: Support for setting Target Temperature and switching between `Heat` and `Off` modes.

## Installation

### 1. HACS (Custom Repository)
1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2. Click the three dots (top-right) and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the URL of your repository and select **Integration** as the category.
4. Click **Download**.
5. **Restart Home Assistant.**

### 2. Manual Installation
1. Copy the `custom_components/tado_local` folder into your HA `/config/custom_components/` directory.
2. **Restart Home Assistant.**

## Configuration
1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **Tado Local**.
3. Enter the details from your AmpScm/TadoLocal instance:
   - **URL**: e.g., `http://192.168.1.50`
   - **Port**: e.g., `8000`
   - **Token**: Your API Bearer Token.
